# Structural-Segmentation-of-Musical-Audio
My Master's Project, a function/system/program that gives the structure of a given song (The pattern of repetition of verse, chorus, etc.) These are all Matlab scripts. The "structSeg" function is the final one that performs this task. It needs all the other functions/scripts listed in the repo. It takes in a .WAV file as input along with the user's estimation of the possible number of sections in the song and outputs the pattern in which similar sections repeat along with their start and end times.
